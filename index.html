                        <p>- Success isn’t built overnight—it’s the result of small, consistent habits. Whether it’s reading a few pages daily, exercising for ten minutes, or practicing gratitude, these simple actions compound over time to create significant change <span class="dots">...</span> <br>
                            <span class="more">- James Clear, in Atomic Habits, emphasizes that "every action is a vote for the person you wish to become." This means that even the smallest efforts matter. Want to be healthier? Start by drinking more water. Want to be more productive? Begin with five-minute planning sessions.<br>
                            - The key is consistency. Small steps reduce overwhelm and make goals more achievable. Over time, they become second nature, leading to profound transformation. So, instead of waiting for the perfect moment, take one small step today. Your future self will thank you.<br>
